The Kinect generates a variety of output streams: color, depth, skeleton, etc. A lesser known stream is the audio stream which enables speech recognition. The audio stream is able to use multiple discrete microphones to calculate a virtual directional microphone. By combining information from the skeletal stream with the directional information from the audio stream, it is possible to determine which of the skeletons is the likely source of the audio.

For the purpose of this problem, a skeleton is a plausible audio source if it is within +/- 10 degrees of the audio beam angle (the actual Kinect can do better).

Input description/format

You will be supplied a set of inputs that includes:

direction of the virtual microphone/beam (in degrees)
a list of up to 6 skeletons, which will include: 
ID (a positive integer)
position (x,y,z)
Positive beam angles are to the right of center, and the microphones listen along the horizontal plane (they can't determine height, only direction).

Notes

0 is an invalid ID
The Kinect should be treated as the origin of a 3-D coordinate system: 
X is the horizontal plane. + is to the right
Y is the vertical plane, + is up
Z is the depth from the sensor and is always non-negative, i.e. it extends in the direction in which the Kinect is pointed
Output description/format

Each line of the output file should be a minified JSON object that lists the IDs of the skeletons that are plausible audio sources.

Example input

{"BeamAngle":0,"Skeletons":[{"ID":1,"Position":{"X":0,"Y":0,"Z":1}},{"ID":2,"Position":{"X":3,"Y":0,"Z":4}},{"ID":3,"Position":{"X":-3,"Y":0,"Z":4}}]}
Example output
