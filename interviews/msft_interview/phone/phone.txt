Phone number parsing | 1 point(s)

Your new Robot Overlords have declared that fleshlingsâ€™ use of multiple representations for phone numbers is inefficient and will no longer be tolerated.

You have been selected to transition the current database of US phone numbers from its current inconsistent formatting to the new Overlord approved format: +11235550100.

Input description/format

The input will be multiple lines, each containing a suspected phone number. Phone numbers can be provided in any of the following common fleshling formats.

Vanity Formats

To make matters worse, vain fleshlings will sometimes represent phone numbers with words. These so-called vanity phone numbers start with 1 and the area code (i.e. 1-123-) but after that they will continue with a mix of letters (upper or lower case), numbers and dashes. They are restricted to using exactly 7 letters and numbers (following the 1 and area code), but dashes can be inserted at any point other than immediately after another dash. Fleshlings make things so complicated! 

For your convenience, a representation of a fleshling dialing pad is included below:

1
2: A B C	
3: D E F
4: G H I	
5: J K L	
6: M N O
7: P Q R S	
8: T U V	
9: W X Y Z

If the line is not recognized, the output line should be Fleshling follow-up needed. If the input line is blank, the output line should also be blank.
